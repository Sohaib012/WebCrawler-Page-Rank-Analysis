# WebCrawler-Page-Rank-Analysis

## Description:

The primary aim of this project was to establish a WebCrawler that would identify the 
rank of a webpage (through which normally search engines evaluate webpages). The 
WebCrawler would then help us in visualizing the data it collected by going through our 
selected set of webpages, on whom a page rank algorithm will be run. This report 
delineates the technologies used, the design, inner working, and visualization of the 
desired output.
